When new characters are added, just add them to the end of the characters.txt file.
Similarly, if you want to edit character names and name May "Worst girl" or
something, you can. Do note that the program reads previous wins based on
the name, so renaming characters restarts the count, as the program reads
it as a new, separate character to track.

I hope there are no bugs, enjoy
